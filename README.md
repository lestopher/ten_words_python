ten_words_python
================
Inspired by this [article](http://scottchamberlin.tumblr.com/post/55152416452/linqinterview). I got bored and decided to write a ruby program to count the ten most common words in a document. 

Run by:
    
    python ten_words_ruby.py constitution

Feel free to run constitution or independence or add another file to run. See original in [Ruby](https://github.com/lestopher/ten_words_ruby)
